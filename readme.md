WordPress Query Components
==========================

Query components and redux "ducks" & selectors for use with the WordPress REST API.

Very much a work-in-progress! Currently best used as a submodule in a theme, see [Foxhound](https://github.com/ryelle/Foxhound).

This uses the [`wordpress-rest-api`](https://github.com/kadamwhite/wordpress-rest-api) package to get your site's data via Query Components ([inspired by calypso](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/our-approach-to-data.md#query-components)). The Query Components call the API, which via actions set your site's data into the state.
